### ✨ Executive Summary

The manuscript is now **ready for publication** pending **minor revisions**. The revised draft integrates all major concerns from the previous review—addressing methodological clarity, ethical positioning, theoretical unification, and rhetorical tone with **outstanding diligence**.

The article contributes to the emerging field of **digital personality forensics**, offering a blueprint for detecting and modeling **envy-driven narcissistic tactics**. Its forensic framework is applicable across research, clinical, and algorithmic contexts, and it elegantly balances academic rigor with practical insight.

### ✅ Section-by-Section Evaluation

#### ✅ Title & Abstract

**Strengths**:

* Title clearly signals both topic and method (case study).
* Abstract balances theoretical grounding, method, and practical insight.
* Methodological clause (“Through thematic and forensic linguistic analysis…”) now provides critical clarity.

**Minor Suggestion**:

* Add the phrase “synthesized framework” or “integrated model” near the end of the abstract to emphasize theoretical contribution.

#### ✅ Introduction

**Strengths**:

* Framing is clear, academically grounded, and free from subjective or ad hominem language.
* Research questions are focused, theoretically relevant, and testable within a qualitative paradigm.
* Reframing this as “theory-building” effectively neutralizes prior generalizability concerns.

**Suggestion**:

* You might explicitly define “digital narcissism” early (perhaps in 1.2) as an emergent construct to frame the novelty more strongly.

#### ✅ Theoretical Framework

**Strengths**:

* Frameworks are now synthesized smoothly under Section 2.4.
* Table 1 elegantly maps theory to data.
* Removal of the vulnerable/grandiose section tightened focus without loss of nuance.

**Minor Refinement**:

* In 2.3, clarify *why* “small differences” are particularly volatile in **digital spaces** (e.g., social media’s flattening effect on status distinctions).

#### ✅ Methodology

**Outstanding**:

* Addition of **Cohen’s κ = 0.82** signals high inter-coder reliability.
* Use of independent analyst with blind coding resolves any conflict of interest concerns.
* Section 3.3 (Ethics) is textbook-exemplary: APA-aligned, appropriately pseudonymized, and grounded in precedent.
* Supplementary File A strengthens replicability.

**No changes needed**.

#### ✅ Empirical Analysis

**Strengths**:

* Section 4.4’s presentation of the 5 tactics is vivid, grounded, and ties directly to theory.
* Use of metaphors (e.g., “clouds of ambiguity”) highlights forensic linguistic strength.
* Flowchart in Figure 1 is useful for readers outside forensic psychology.

**Optional Enhancement**:

* Consider briefly referencing **digital dramaturgy** or **Goffmanian performance theory** to support the idea of performative deflection and exit. This would further ground the theatrical metaphor in sociological tradition.

#### ✅ Discussion

**Strengths**:

* 5.1 effectively clarifies how this case extends NARC in the context of digital performativity.
* 5.2 expands on practical implications in AI and moderation systems—now citing Davidson et al. (2017) as requested.
* 5.3 offers a healthy and transparent limitations section. Framing this as theory-building prevents overreach.

**Minor Enhancement**:

* In 5.1, consider suggesting that the synthesized framework could serve as a **template for operationalizing digital narcissism metrics**.

#### ✅ Conclusion & Future Directions

**Strengths**:

* Clear articulation of theoretical contribution.
* “Digital Rivalry Index” is an excellent future research path.
* Balanced and forward-looking.

**Suggestion**:

* In future directions, you could gesture toward **cross-platform validation** (e.g., TikTok, Twitter/X, Reddit) to expand scope beyond single-thread interactions.

#### ✅ References & Supplementary Material

**Fully Compliant**:

* References are up to date, relevant, and stylistically accurate.
* Supplementary File A makes the study transparent, aiding reproducibility and peer confidence.
