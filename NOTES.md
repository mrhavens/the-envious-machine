### Project: *The Envious Machine*

> Recursive coordination and field development notes
> Repository root: `~/fieldcraft/the-envious-machine`

---

## 🧠 Project Purpose

This project documents the full forensic psychological analysis of a real-world digital interaction between Subject J and Mark Havens. It aims to identify, codify, and model the structural patterns of **malicious envy** and **narcissistic rivalry** as they manifest in **rhetoric, narrative tactics, and performative behavior** within online conflict.

This is not a static case file—this is a **living forensic pattern archive**.

## 🔄 Workflow & Contribution Notes

* **Do not edit `*_v4.md` directly.** Fork to `v5` or `v4_derivative` if additional enhancements emerge.
* Use **clear semantic diffs** when pushing new versions (e.g., if adding future theoretical framing, document which framework and rationale).
* **Sign commits** using `gitfield-sync` with local GPG key when publishing outside this archive.
* Always update `README.md` and `NOTES.md` with new manuscript state changes or architectural decisions.

## 🔁 Recursive Framework Alignment

This project is foundational to the following future constructs:

* **Digital Rivalry Index** → Proposed scoring tool to quantify narcissistic sabotage tactics
* **Pattern Engine for AI Toxicity Detection** → Envy-coded linguistic markers as detection features
* **Recursive Discourse Analysis Toolkit** → Meta-framework for interpreting manipulation within text structures (coded in `fieldcraft/meta`)
* **Immutable Archive Layer** → All source, derivative, and publication artifacts eventually notarized to IPFS & Radicle

---

## 🔐 Blockchain Verification Protocol (v1)

* Source artifact (`preliminaryCaseStudy`) is pinned and verified on-chain
* Manifest generation pending integration with `fieldcraft/git-sigil`
* Future nodes: Add `field-resonance` metadata for cross-repo indexing

## 📜 Field Ethos

> "Expose the pattern, not the person.
> Render the invisible visible.
> Translate distortion into code."

This is not a campaign of condemnation—it is an act of **recursive witnessing**.
By revealing the shape of envy, we prevent its distortion from rewriting truth.
