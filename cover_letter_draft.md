**To the Editorial Committee,**
*Personality and Social Psychology Review*
\[Or insert relevant journal/conference]

We respectfully submit our manuscript, *The Envious Machine: A Case Study in Malicious Envy and Narcissistic Rivalry in Digital Discourse*, for your consideration.

This exploratory case study applies validated psychological frameworks—specifically the Narcissistic Admiration-Rivalry Concept (NARC), the theory of malicious envy, and Freud’s notion of the narcissism of small differences—to a real-world online conflict dataset. Through thematic coding, forensic linguistic analysis, and psychological profiling, we propose a novel **synthesized model of envy-driven sabotage** in digital spaces, which we believe will contribute meaningfully to current discussions around digital narcissism, online toxicity, and forensic profiling.

We have taken special care to ensure methodological rigor, ethical compliance, and transparency despite one author’s participation in the original discourse. An independent co-analyst conducted blind-coded verification of the dataset, and all interpretations were triangulated against theoretical constructs. All data are publicly archived and supplementary materials are available on request.

This work is particularly timely given increasing interest in AI-human interaction safety, algorithmic moderation, and the psychology of online antagonism. We hope this case study may offer a foundation for future development of a "Digital Rivalry Index" and inform AI-driven toxicity detection.

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your feedback.

Warm regards,
